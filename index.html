    <h1>Viruses and Worms are malicious
programs that self replicate. They exploit
security vulnerabilities allowing the
programs to spread among computers.
Worm attacks are usual targeted at
companies systems rather than personal
devices. Worm attacks spread on their
own and can appear through
communication such as email with a link
that will start the worm discretely. Viruses
are very similar to worms but they need a
corrupt system in order for it to be able to
run. Viruses and Worms cost billions of
dollars in damage every year and
discreetly corrupt thousands of
computers.</h1>
